# Welcome to EarthScope's Cloud Data and Developer Documentation Center!

```{Note}
This [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) is in development as we configure our cloud documentation center.
```

The EarthScope-operated data systems of the NSF GAGE and SAGE Facilities are migrating to cloud services. With this transition comes new capabilities for users to use cloud computing for their own work. Use the links on this page to explore documentation for using our Cloud Data tools and services
